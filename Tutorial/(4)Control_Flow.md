# Control Flow

The order in which statements in a program execute can vary greatly. Most programs are not organized to run in a strictly linear fashion--instead, statements are often grouped into blocks of code, each of which will be evaluated depending on its initial condition. Statements and code blocks such as these are said to alter the flow of program control. 

## Conditional Statements

Perhaps the simplest type of control statement is the family of if, if-else, and if-else if-else statements. 

```c
  int x = 10;
  if(x%2 == 0){                           // The output of this statement will be: "10 is an even number."
		printf(" is an even number.\n");      // because the remainder of 10 modulo 2 is 0, thus the condition is true
	}else{
		printf(" is not even.\n");
	}
```
