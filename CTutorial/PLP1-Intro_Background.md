# C

C is an imperative (procedural), general-purpose programming language. It is a compiled, structural language that does not make use of a Virtual Machine. C's highly portable nature allows for accessible cross-platform implementation, and is thus one of the most influential programming languages ever invented.

Though many languages have borrowed from C (Perl, PHP, Python, Java, C++, C# and Objective-C to name a few), there have always been a limited number of versions of this language in use. ANSI C, standardized by the ISO in 1990 and therefore more commonly known as C89 or C90, is still widely in use today. Code written in purely Standard C, on the other hand, may only partially compile in the absence of updated hardware specifications provided by more recent versions (C99, C11, and certain versions of Embedded C). 

# History

C was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs between 1969-1973. It was originally intended to make use of certain features of the Unix operating system, such as byte-addressability, which could not be accessed by assembly-language. It's portability later allowed the majority of Unix's kernel to be re-written in C, making it the one of the first operating systems to be implemented in this manner. 

# Usage

C is commonly used to program operating and embedded systems, due to its portability and low-level associations with memory. It is also used in many compilers and interpreters of other languages, and even as an intermediate language in specific instances.
